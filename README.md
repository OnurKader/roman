# Roman and Decimal Converter

Just something I needed, so I threw in some things together and made a simple converter

## Installation

Run `make` in `src/` to build

To install run `make install`, it will require root privileges by default, you can change it in the `Makefile`

## Usage

```
$ roman XXI 2020
XXI is 21
2020 is MMXX

$ roman
> 42
XLII
> CXLI
141
```
